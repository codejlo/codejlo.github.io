		<p>Despite the use of scripts and features that we have not yet encountered, the html at Alpine Exposures is highly organized and readable. Extensive use of block elements structures the page in ways that make intuitive sense. A suggestion that the page creator takes pride in his or her work is the large insignia created with text characters that appears in the head of the source code...very cool actually.</p>
